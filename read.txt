BACKEND-
_____________________________________________________________

1-bcryptjs: used to hash passwords before we store them in our database
2-body-parser: used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware
3-concurrently: allows us to run our backend and frontend concurrently and on different ports

5-is-empty: global function that will come in handy when we use validator
6-jsonwebtoken: used for authorization
7-mongoose: used to interact with MongoDB
8-passport: used to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as strategies
